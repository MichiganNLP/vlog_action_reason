The .json data file contains all the data we collect and annotate. 

The keys contain the name of the video urls and the time stamps they are downloaded at. 
For example, 'NdnyiDBi7Ik+0:07:25+0:08:06.mp4?raw=true' can be found on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdnyiDBi7Ik, and it starts at 0:07:25 and ends at 0:08:06.

The values contain the annotations from the 3 workers: the reasons, the confidence, the justification and comments.
