husband and my clothes so for all of the spaces it starts with just decluttering picking up any clothes sweeping the floors putting everything back where it belongs that alone makes the space look so much and then you can do deep cleaning kind of at your own discretion which is what I do when I am cleaning so that is why am actually going to after I sweep the floor I am gonna steam mop the floor

of summer dinners outside and I am gonna carry it on over to the back of the property where we have our little mulch", ["declutter", "remove dirt"], ["both"]], ["but I like one on the table with a

taking a broom and and my hands with some gloves and trying to clean out the gutters as best as possible and whatever amount of leaves I could do with the ladder and whatever I felt safe doing and it is basically adding a PVC pipe a long PVC pipe to the end of the blower and that makes it so that nobody has to get on the roof and that is ideal and then he got on the roof and blew the rest of the

that I want to try", ["remove dirt"], ["both"]], ["then also the fireplace you may need to call someone to clean it or inspect it we had ours inspected recently and I do clean it at the end of winter

kitchen cabinets and getting rid of anything that you know I no longer use or has broken or has cracks or anything so that is something I would recommend doing also at the turn of the season cleaning out the oven pretty much cleans everything is another really good one same type of thing dish soap and baking soda", ["remove dirt", "do not like dirtiness"], ["shown"]], ["so that is why always remind everybody who watches my videos that I have two kids three dogs and a crazy family crazy and loud family living in my home so that is why enjoy cleaning and getting it as organized as possible

like to enforce it if they are super comfortable so that is why am just gonna let Ozzie sleep there and I am gonna fluff the pillows and continue cleaning up the kids toys now if I am doing a quick

then I have a basket with all of my sprays so what I use for when the dogs have an accident some disinfectant spray window spray all purpose I have a toilet bowl cleanser and then I also have the cleanser for the floors now today I am focusing on the windows so that is why am gonna be cleaning the windows and the little crack at the bottom of the window gets extra dirty but if I am not using

a cleaning towel and a butter knife to get rid of any additional residue like the baking soda or any leftover vinegar and suggest continue to clean so that is why tried to get it as clean as possible so much better alright is that they generally do not like peppermint so if you put a little tiny bit of peppermint on a paper towel and just rub it against the window it kind of prevents spiders and bugs and things from collecting there it does help a little bit obviously you know when you live in certain areas bugs and pests I also live out in the country where there are lots of pests and bugs and one little quick tip", ["remove dirt"], ["shown"]], ["and it is sticky I also cleaned all the windows themselves so that they were not dirty and gross looking so the inside and the outside so this is kind of a big job depending on how big your house is so that is why say start with a window or two everyday and just try to get it done when you can or spend a full day if you have that to try to clean them all is usually how I tackle these types of projects adding a little bit of wd 40 but it can be daunting to do them all so a little bit at a time", ["do not like dirtiness", "remove dirt"],

to the store to get everything that I need I am gonna need room so that is why do like to do this about a week ahead of time to a few days depending on what time you have I clean everything out and I make space for everything that I am going to get at the grocery store and then so that is why it reduces any stress because I find that a clean fridge when you are hosting is definitely essential one

think they might have forgotten or might need", ["declutter", "remove dirt", "company was coming"], ["both"]], ["sometimes it is once every other week I try to do it once a week if possible because

to do this so that is why highly recommend reading it and familiarizing yourself of everything and also how to set it up that will explain it even better than I could in this video each breast pump is a little bit different in the parts that you need to sterilize but pretty much across the board it does recommend that you boil the parts before and then from then on you want to make sure you have a bottle cleaner I like this one by dapple my friend actually gave it to me and you can use that to clean all the parts that come in contact with milk from that moment on after you have started using it for this breast pump I have a face plate which is what this is called and then you have the power adapter and you have tubing ports a port plug and then tubing so that is why am just putting the

channel but I have tried so many different things and these work well for the stovetop and the stainless steel so now moving on to the sink and dishes which again is another daily task I use the pop up sponges from Trader Joe", ["do not like dirtiness", "remove dirt"], ["both"]], ["so I like the stainless steel scrubber sponges they work well for cleaning the sink itself and also certain pans you have to be careful because you ca not use it on everything and then like a scrubber brush so those are kind of like my kitchen tools and then that I use a little bit of water a tiny bit of soap and those pop up sponges to clean out my dishes and stick them in the dishwasher so now for cleaning the sink I use baking soda and the seventh generation cleaning dish soap so that is why put the baking soda first and then I use my scrubber stainless steel brush to scrub scrub scrub I always use my gloves when I do the dishes and when I clean out the sink then when it comes to the disposal and then I

said i am going to keep a close eye on this area for spider webs and bugs because this area is in our living room and dining room so i like to keep it as clean as possible usually at the end of the season when we are no longer using the fireplace we give it a nice clean and throughout the season we clean it out pretty regularly so it does not smell is to clean all the windows and then i give it

them up on my herb drying rack outside that usually takes about two to three days you can use a mortar and pestle if you are doing a fine seasoning which I like to do for my thyme and oregano but for peppermint lemon balm chamomile I can use my fingers to break up the leaves or pull the chamomile flowers off the stems I collect bundles", ["reduce stress", "healthy"], ["both"]], ["the stainless steel tea infusers are really great to have on hand because you can do blends of tea with them so that is why am adding a little chamomile catnip and lemon balm it is a great feeling to grow your own

my tea drawer to look before bed I have my fair share of teas from the grocery store and I have a tea drawer that is pretty messy", ["self care", "reduce stress", "help sleep"], ["both"]], ["I am gonna brush my lips I like to do this because exfoliating your lips makes them look a little bit more plump and then I am gonna relax in the tub and try to enjoy this time in the Epsom salt bath which

that I love to use for tea lemon balm has been used for centuries to treat anxiety sleep disorders indigestion and various wounds so that is why like to brew a cup of lemon balm tea before I go to

great for that also it is great for digestion as is mint tea for kind of relaxing the stomach if you have eaten too much", ["help sleep", "reduce stress"], ["both"]], ["so I am using the nighttime
