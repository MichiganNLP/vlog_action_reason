actually going to be making some almond milk from home using my almond cow machine i usually do cashew or oat", 82.56, 91.52], ["but today i am making almond yogurt from my experience so far making yogurt almond makes the best yogurt either almond or cashew so you can go for either ore", 88.64, 118.159], ["and i will put the recipe below in my description box", 113.759, 120.56], ["you are going to need the culture starter", 118.719, 126.32000000000001], ["and so i found that on thrive one portion of almond milk is set aside and you add pectin to it", 120.56, 130.319], ["you can blend it in a blender the other portion is going to be slowly warmed up to 140 degrees", 126.32, 136.56], ["and you add a little bit of calcium water", 132.239, 138.39999999999998], ["then you mix those two

that your yogurt is made with as few ingredients", 184.4, 189.36], ["as possible this yogurt culture also had amazing reviews", 188.159, 194.8], ["so what i can do here is my mixture at 110 degrees

know that i was able to make it from home with minimal ingredients and the way that i like to enjoy my yogurt", 243.36, 254.0], ["is by adding a little bit of turmeric which i ended up buying a big

vines and everything out of the way of the irrigation", 141.53, 148.52], ["then we are gonna move that then we are gonna let the chickens come over and enjoy whatever they want there is um lots of

some popsicle sticks so that is why I can label it", 320.2, 338.62], ["and then you want seed starting soil", 334.0, 339.85], ["so there is a certain kind of soil you want to ask for when you go there", 336.31, 343.81], ["so that is why am going to fill up the little pods the little tray with the seed starting soil I am going to go ahead and add that", 339.85, 350.08], ["and then I am going

of money", 388.43, 401.0], ["so really you need two seeds per pod", 395.35, 403.13], ["so I am going to make a little hole put two seeds in there then cover the hole", 401.0, 408.65], ["and I am going

are going to make little seed bombs so after you put that in a food processor", 459.82, 477.379], ["I am going to put it over a strainer and push out any extra water", 473.389, 482.3], ["and then I am

going to let that mixture cool for five to ten minutes until it starts to get a syrupy texture", 131.41, 142.959], ["and then I am going to take a spoon and create little drops so that is why am going to let these dry you can stick them in the refrigerator or the freezer to help that process along a little bit", 137.799, 152.41], ["but I by taking a spoon you can try to make as even as possible

loved it", 323.4, 329.75899999999996], ["so again full recipe will be in the description but I am adding cheddar cheese and some flour now of course if there is a type of flour that you like to use

its appearance as it becomes more and more orange", 353.969, 364.399], ["so I am going to remove the top of the food processor I am going to take a spatula and kind of push everything down in the

that is why would say 16 minutes is probably the perfect amount to bake depending on the temperature of your oven and how your oven works exactly but about between 15 and 17 minutes I added a little bit of salt on top and this is obviously a special treat that looked like a lot of salt", 496.569, 517.919], ["but it was not that much", 514.539, 520.449], ["I promise um this was a special treat for

ultrasound removing your due date up to the 15th", 360.21, 372.66], ["so it ended up being that he was 38 weeks in three days which made me feel a lot better than even 37 weeks because that meant that

are gonna hurt", 480.96, 486.96], ["and so that is why can get your epidural anytime", 483.84, 489.0], ["you want it was 12 30 at night at that point", 485.97, 492.15], ["and I had been there pretty

still feel the baby", 535.82, 542.02], ["but I could not feel any of the contraction pain or uncomfortability", 537.46, 546.65], ["so that is why fell asleep and then when I woke up she came to like
