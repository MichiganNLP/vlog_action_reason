is why are gonna get all of the vegetables prepped and that is probably the hardest part of this recipe", 74.479, 83.439], ["and i am using rutabagas because i like to challenge myself to try new vegetables", 78.32, 87.92], ["it is not a common vegetable in a lot of recipes", 84.72, 91.119], ["but it is really delicious and rutabagas are actually a cruciferous vegetable and they are a cross between a turnip and a cabbage", 87.92, 99.27999999999999], ["so they are very very healthy for you", 96.88, 100.479], ["but they taste like a mix between a potato and a sweet potato", 96.88, 108.96],

dishes", 133.76, 139.68], ["and i think that they are as satisfying as potatoes", 138.0, 143.44], ["so we have got those chopped up now into fourth inch pieces we are gonna dice our onion you are gonna dice your onion like you normally dice your onion", 141.44, 164.16], ["now i am going to prep my celery and besides the onion all the vegetables like the rutabaga the celery the carrot", 164.16,

the same in the slow cooker and your bite that you get is like nice and uniform if that makes sense so that is why are going to chop up our carrot just the same i love adding carrot because it adds a brightness adds the beautiful orange color there is so many colors and textures going on in this stew", 178.879, 203.04], ["and i think the carrot is is good you could swap it out for parsnips or additional rutabaga or additional potatoes if you do not have them", 198.48, 210.48], ["so now we have got our potatoes", 208.64, 213.76], ["i just rinsed them in a colander in the sink", 208.64,

one cup of dried brown lentils i like to rinse them to", 227.44, 238.959], ["they are nice and clean", 237.439, 240.72], ["and then i add those straight to the slow cooker", 238.959, 245.12], ["and

red lentils and this is an optional add in i am adding some sausage so about four sausage links", 247.04, 260.959], ["and i cooked them up in a pan before adding them to the slow cooker but", 255.439,

liked the little extra bit of sausage", 274.56, 279.44], ["it is nice and smoky and salty", 276.0, 283.68], ["and i think it goes really well with lentils so you will see that i added that on top at the end so that is why are gonna salt and pepper everything add some minced garlic and six cups of chicken stock or chicken broth", 279.44, 297.68], ["i would recommend going for a low sodium option so that is why can control the amount of salt", 295.199, 303.11999999999995], ["and so that is why it is not too too salty", 300.56, 304.56], ["and then you are gonna mix everything together", 300.56, 308.08], ["then i added my cooked sausage that i had cut up in bite sized pieces and then last but not least you are going to throw in a bay leaf for some extra flavor while it cooks so that is everything in the slow cooker", 305.44, 320.96000000000004], ["you are going to turn it on", 319.6, 323.759], ["and here you can either do 8 to ten hours on low or you can do three to four hours on high", 320.96, 330.15999999999997], ["so depending on what your schedule looks like that day it is very versatile either way it is gonna taste incredible so when your meal is about ready like a half an hour before the time is going to go off", 328.479, 343.52], ["or you know when you get home or you can have this done and prepped ready to go", 340.56, 347.52], ["you are going to chop up some kale

texture of it", 355.68, 360.88], ["and i added it right to my slow cooker and left it in there for i do not know like five to ten minutes it could be longer if you want it to or shorter depending on

it happen to me", 279.65, 285.25899999999996], ["but if you shave too soon before you use the sunless tanner the little bits of like the dark brown color can get into your hair follicles and kind of
