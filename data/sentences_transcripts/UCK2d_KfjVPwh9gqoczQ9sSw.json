we are just making adjustments", 396.56, 403.13], ["and it is really easy to make adjustments so instead of doing one and three quarter cups I am gonna do a cut that will be good", 399.95, 411.56],

mess", 414.68, 436.46000000000004], ["so I put a cup of the army butter so this recipe you are supposed to apparently do in a food processor I do not have a food processor", 428.6, 444.8], ["so that is why are gonna try to do it by hand", 441.23, 446.47999999999996], ["if not I am gonna use the blender I guess we are gonna see we are gonna see how it goes hoping for the best I need to get a food

baking tray", 483.5, 496.21999999999997], ["so that is why did have to add more water to the recipe but that is because I am not using a food processor like", 491.15, 500.79], ["if I was they use a food processor", 496.22, 503.31], ["it would have just like worked perfectly with how the recipe was on the app", 498.9, 506.88], ["but I needed to add a little bit of more water just to do it to do it with my hands because the food process that would have like blended up the coconut", 503.31, 518.52], ["but I feel like this is work well with just using extra water easy so because I do not have any sprinkles I am gonna cut up chop up some bacon chocolate and sprinkle that on top I am gonna try to chop it up fine me", 512.909, 533.339], ["and I think Rob is gonna gonna like this cuz you like chocolate", 530.61, 538.74], ["this is a hundred percent dark baking chocolate", 533.339, 539.8499999999999], ["no should go anything", 536.31, 542.01], ["but I feel like that", 538.74, 542.01], ["is gonna go perfectly here", 538.74, 545.25], ["so that is why am gonna sort of press it", 539.85, 548.88], ["in a bit it is still gonna be like you know freaky on the top smells so good", 542.01,

be good if it is like cold", 569.279, 576.75], ["I will probably set even better", 570.779, 579.0], ["and then we will be ready for us to try it actually make one more SD", 574.68, 580.709], ["so it says two tablespoons of water for the full recipe so half of the recipe should have been 1 tablespoon of water but other 4 tablespoons of water so that I could mix it with my hands", 576.75,

one on the app which is pretty similar the recipe does call for some roasted cashew nuts chopped up on the top they do not have any cashew nuts", 624.87, 642.99], ["so that is why are gonna use some dry roasted and salted almonds which is I feel it is gonna be really delicious", 637.439, 649.139], ["I was starting by chopping these ones up because this rest is gonna go good like quickly", 645.54,

mason jars you can also just use covered mugs or glasses and you will also need some reusable Ziploc bags or other small containers for snacks and other items so because we want a meal prep seven full

really well in a salad better other leafy greens so that is why love using this I am dividing the kale into two salad bowls so that we can make two salad variations", 381.139, 412.02], ["and I am

6 eggs to make hard boiled eggs for three of the lunches", 687.72, 704.31], ["so that is why will use 2 eggs per serving carefully add the eggs to a pot of hot water and bring the water to a boil in
