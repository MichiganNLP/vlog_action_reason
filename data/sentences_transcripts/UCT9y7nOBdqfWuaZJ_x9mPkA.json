first let is get into this one if you want to create a new note or page or whatever it is", 445.919, 452.639], ["so you can go to the top right where there is a little thing with the pencil and you click that", 449.039, 458.4], ["and then you can go to the three dots up in the top right corner and hit paper", 453.919, 461.039], ["this is where you can decide what type of paper you want to be

also a dotted line", 514.32, 523.1999999999999], ["so then if you click the tool right next to the pencil and it looks like a highlighter because it is a highlighter there is the same options for that

the hashtag is you enter the hex code", 644.24, 654.079], ["so this one is c08879", 648.56, 654.079], ["and there is the color", 652.8, 655.3599999999999], ["and you hit the check mark", 652.8,

i have to cut straight lines but", 301.199, 322.0], ["the standard densions that i found for a face mask for an adult are two nine by six inch fabric pieces that will be facing each other if you are doing a double layer mask like i am", 318.0, 332.08000000000004], ["and then two pieces of elastic that are both 6 5 inches long", 329.52, 336.88], ["but i tried that out at the beginning and realized

that you guys are watching me cut out right now that are eight by six inches and then two pieces of elastic that are six inches long", 349.759, 364.71999999999997], ["so the beauty of laying the fabric out in the way that you were going to sew it together is that the sides are already perfectly lined up and all you have to do before you sew is pin it together to make sure that it does not move or anything", 359.28, 375.91900000000004], ["so then what you want to do with the elastic", 374.479, 380.4], ["is you want to kind of fold up the top piece the one that has the print on it and

sewing", 388.24, 393.039], ["so i always start on whatever side i want to be the bottom", 390.0, 397.12], ["and then i find about the halfway point of that side", 395.6, 400.72], ["and then i go a little bit further down and start sewing there because you are going to want to have an opening in the bottom so that you can flip the fabric around when you are done sewing it", 397.12, 406.56], ["i sew a straight stitch i am going to be using a straight stitch throughout this entire tutorial here", 405.84, 416.72], ["i am hitting part of the elastic", 410.319, 416.72], ["so i am going over the elastic one or two tes to make sure that it is strongly reinforced", 410.319, 423.84], ["now i have finished sewing in both sides of the elastic and i am back on the bottom end of the mask like i said

like to pull on the ends of the elastic to make sure that corners are fully pulled out", 465.28, 472.879], ["so there we have our mask right side out something that i like to do in between this step and the next step", 469.44, 479.84], ["though is use my iron and smooth down the fabric so that it is less bulky it makes it easier to work with and then at the bottom where we have the hole i am folding the printed layer as you are seeing here", 476.08, 491.44], ["i kind of tuck it under itself and iron it down so that the raw hem is not exposed moving back to our sewing table", 488.08,

little bit i am making sure to not pin it directly on the very end because then it will make it way more difficult to sew", 505.199, 514.9590000000001], ["and i will have to take the pins out while i am sewing", 511.759, 516.88], ["and that is too much", 514.959, 516.88], ["so i do not measure where these pleats go", 514.959, 520.64], ["i kind of eyeball it", 516.88, 523.6800000000001], ["and wherever i feel like it looks right to me that is where i will do it if it is not perfect do not freak out about it", 518.719, 529.76], ["the point is that you want to have pleats because then we are going to sew down the sides of them", 526.48, 534.72], ["and then the mask will be able to do that thing where when you put it on your face and you like tug on the bottom and the top it expands and it looks like a face mask", 531.519, 540.72], ["you know what i mean that this is what we have to do to get it to look like that", 539.44, 544.8], ["so back to the sewing machine we go", 541.76, 546.16],

flatten out the front of this mask so that the pleats are flattened and it has a crisper look and feel to it", 564.399, 580.0], ["so that is all for the creation of the mask itself we are done with

was like a link on the website where you could do the finance application online so that when you get there you do not have to sit there and fill it out and then wait for them to process it", 741.2,

your own personal bank", 844.72, 848.32], ["you could go through whatever bank", 846.32, 852.0790000000001], ["the dealership partners with it is literally up to you if you want to shop around and contact different banks and see which one can get you the lowest interest rate you can do that i decided to do it through the dealership and the bank that they partner with because the interest rate that i got was good", 848.32, 866.959], ["i was basically given a piece of paper", 862.88, 869.36], ["and it had a chart where it was like your interest rate the length of the loan in months", 864.639, 873.519], ["and then the monthly payment so obviously as you get to longer loan lengths", 869.36, 878.48], ["your monthly payment is lower because you are spreading it out over a longer period of te", 874.32, 880.5600000000001], ["the longest option that i was given was 72 months so a six year loan my interest rate was the same for all of the different loan lengths", 878.48, 891.04],

finance department said they were like that", 888.88, 902.48], ["is typically what happens because when you are spreading it out that long there is a higher risk that the person would default on the loan", 900.24, 909.68], ["so therefore the interest rate is higher but my interest rate was the same for all the different loan lengths", 906.16, 916.32], ["so i ended up going with the 72 month loan

cost of the car is then i will take out a loan for the rest what i was advised by the bank that i took the loan out through for my first car was to not pay the loan off no matter if i have the ability to do not pay it off until it has been 11 or 12 months you want to establish a pattern of being able to pay your monthly payments on te every month because that is what will build your credit",

another check and say i wanted to allocate 400 a month to my loan", 973.199, 980.32], ["so 200 of it already went to the monthly payment", 976.24, 984.8000000000001], ["the other 200 i would write a separate check make it out for 200 to the bank and write principal", 980.32, 988.8], ["what that means is that money does not go towards paying off any interest principal", 987.759, 997.839], ["is how much money you took out for the loan does not include the interest that will accrue say that the total that i needed to take a loan out for was seven thousand dollars the principal of the loan when you first take it out is seven thousand dollars every month it starts to accrue interest so when you do your monthly payment it goes towards the total of the loan which is your principal and the interest that is accrued if you write principal it will go towards the principal part so that the next month if your principal is lower there is less to charge interest on", 993.519, 1028.4], ["does that make sense obviously when you are taking out a loan interest", 1026.4, 1032.959], ["is inevitable but you want to pay as little of it as is legal", 1029.52, 1036.4], ["that is my two cents on

payment down", 1042.559, 1045.76], ["you have to have the loan secured and in place and approved and everything before you can drive it up a lot because until you do that is still the property of the

face of the earth if you want an in depth tutorial of how I basically learned how to do this I am going put this guy is a video in the description", 641.49, 655.32], ["bar his name", 651.69, 655.32], ["is Daniel", 651.69, 655.32], ["this video was so freakin helpful and", 651.69, 657.33], ["then also in his description and in his video he talks about his adment layers that he has", 653.25, 663.4200000000001], ["so that is why can go on there is a link in his video description box to download the adment layers", 659.1, 667.14], ["and then he explains what those are for and there is also a link right under that to show you how to install them because I know I had a little bit of issue installing them", 663.42, 676.2299999999999], ["I do not use the base correction layer", 672.06,

basically if you want to go in and ad", 679.38, 687.42], ["you know the brightness saturation highlights shadows any of that", 682.65, 691.86], ["basically what I did I downloaded his adment layers they are free you can make a donation", 687.42, 694.77], ["if you want to this guy is awesome", 691.86, 696.3], ["so I honestly should have made a donation", 693.3, 697.92], ["but I downloaded them", 694.77, 699.78], ["and they are in my title section of Final Cut", 696.3, 701.1899999999999], ["and then I use the one called look grade they honestly both do the exact same thing like they are blank as they are", 697.92, 706.89], ["and you are the one that puts in the color wheel to make the effect", 703.17, 710.91], ["so this is the point in the video where I am going turn off my color greeting

use", 706.89, 725.23], ["is orange and teal", 721.54, 725.23], ["so basically let is get freaking started", 721.54, 726.639], ["and I will try and give you guys a very compact explanation of how I did this to do this I dragged look grade layer on to my video and then in the effects tab on Final Cut you go to color and then at the very top left", 723.55, 739.42], ["it is the first one it is called color board", 735.79, 742.449], ["I dragged that to the look grade layer thing so on the top right next to your video", 737.38, 746.709], ["you will see color board show up", 742.449,

say that saturation and exposure I do not mess with personally for my color grading you can do that if you want to so the saturation exposure types I do not touch but the color tab is where you do the work", 751.42, 767.32], ["so there are these circles in the middle of this rainbow looking screen", 763.269, 771.1], ["so if I would drag this one right here is the master and basically that changes

one is the mid tones tab it is like the grayish one", 781.72, 793.389], ["the white one is the highlights ones for the orange and teal color grading which is the model that I follow", 788.11, 798.61],

go down into mid tones and this degree it is how it is going to move it along the line we are going want to drag that into the orange area and then in order to introduce orange into your picture you want to use the percentage thing you want to drag it upwards and that as you see on the color board it will start making it more orange", 809.05, 835.0], ["and then for the shadows we want that to be in the teal section which it already kind of is then", 829.75, 839.199], ["you introduce that into your picture as well obviously you can see it is", 836.829, 843.01], ["freaking green", 841.18,

less green", 846.61, 853.4499999999999], ["you take the percentage section tab", 848.17, 855.5790000000001], ["and you drag it down and that takes the green out of the picture now", 850.57,

of positioned in the blue", 861.31, 866.4699999999999], ["but you want it to be in the pink once it is in the pink", 863.05, 869.62], ["so that is why am going to go to the percentage thing", 866.47,

fix it if I want to so", 873.639, 880.6600000000001], ["that is why can go back and keep messing with it to get what I want the look that I want but to say that I like this", 876.19, 886.389], ["and I like how this looks", 882.19, 886.389], ["this is what the clip looks like without the color green and this is what it looks like with the color grid so without with without with if this is what I
