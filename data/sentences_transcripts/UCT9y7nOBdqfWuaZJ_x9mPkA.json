thought that i made one that i finally liked i ended up changing it anyways that will happen in a second", 838.32, 849.519], ["so i cut a fairly long piece of twine and i wrapped it around the top of this mug and tied it in a super cute bow if i do say so myself", 846.079, 859.76], ["and there is the updated tag that i made", 857.36, 860.88], ["so that is it for the tag label situation now getting

cup inside of the pot and turning the stove on high to boil the water so the water in the pot obviously will get very very hot as it is going to be boiling", 901.279, 928.24], ["which will then cause

time because i have done this before i do not know why i did not do it", 967.839, 977.6800000000001], ["but anyway i wrapped the wick around a pencil and let it dangle in there", 974.639, 982.32],

zoom all at the same time and the professor attends the same time and we have a synchronous lecture and then for the other day of the week it flip flops the group who was on zoom then attends in

well", 239.28, 252.07999999999998], ["also there is what is that called liquid stitch or like different stitch glues which is basically sewing but in a glue form if you decide to do that though i would recommend reinforcing the parts where the elastic goes hand sewing over it to that it is secure", 246.64, 267.919], ["i feel like i would probably reinforce the pleats with a hand stitch as well

are going to be sewing it together", 284.16, 293.36], ["we want the right sides or in other words the good sides to be facing each other so when i am laying my fabric out getting ready to cut it",

printed fabric which is obviously the one that is going to be facing outwards that people will see i put the right sides facing each other and smoothed it out and made sure that they were lined up so i am using my quote unquote fabric pizza cutter to cut this fabric because i have to cut straight lines but the standard dimensions that i found for a face mask for an adult are two nine by six inch fabric pieces that will be facing each other if you are doing a double layer mask", 301.199, 332.08000000000004], ["like i am and then two pieces of elastic that are both 6 5 inches long", 327.759, 336.88], ["but i tried that out at the beginning and realized that i needed to tweak that a little bit for myself because my face was a little bit too small for that to fit comfortably so that is the beauty of making your own masks", 332.56, 347.75899999999996], ["is that you can take the standard pattern and tweak it to fit", 344.4, 351.759], ["however you want it to", 347.759, 351.759], ["so my personal dimensions that i have been using two pieces of fabric that you guys are watching me cut out right now", 349.759, 357.84], ["that are eight by six inches and then two pieces of elastic that are six inches long so the beauty of laying the fabric out in the way that you were going to sew it together is that the sides are already perfectly lined up and all you have to do before you sew is pin it together to that it does not move or anything", 355.36, 375.91900000000004], ["so then what you want to do with the elastic is you want to kind of fold up the top piece the one that has the print on it and position the elastic so that the ends of the elastic are in the corners of the fabric", 374.479, 388.24], ["and it is kind of like a sandwich", 384.88, 390.0], ["now we are at the sewing machine and we are ready to start sewing", 388.24, 393.039], ["so i always start on whatever side i want to be the bottom", 390.0, 397.12], ["and then i find about the halfway point of that side", 395.6, 400.72], ["and then i go a little bit further down and start sewing there because you are going to want to have an opening in the bottom so that you can flip the fabric around when you are done sewing it", 397.12, 406.56], ["i sew a straight stitch i am going to be using a straight stitch throughout this entire tutorial here", 405.84, 416.72], ["i am hitting part of the elastic",

bottom end of the mask like i said we need to leave a little gap so that we can flip the mask inside out", 439.36, 453.91900000000004], ["so i am not going to sew all the way and close it so now i am turning this fabric inside out", 449.199, 463.36], ["i am kind of pushing the right side of the fabric out through that little gap that we left at the bottom of the mask", 460.319,

["it makes it easier to work with and then at the bottom where we have the hole i am folding the printed layer as you are seeing here", 479.84, 491.44], ["i kind of tuck it under itself and iron it down so that the raw hem is not exposed moving back to our sewing table", 488.08, 502.16], ["we are ready to do the pleats", 497.36, 502.71999999999997], ["so i make two pleats in my mask as a pleat

out about it", 520.64, 529.76], ["the point is just that you want to have pleats because then we are going to sew down the sides of them", 526.48, 534.72], ["and then the mask will be able to do that thing where when you put it on your face and you like tug on the bottom and the top it expands", 531.519, 540.72], ["and it looks like a face mask", 537.519, 540.72], ["you know what i mean that this is what we have to do to get it to look like that", 539.44, 544.8], ["so back to the sewing machine we go", 541.76, 546.16], ["we are literally going to be sewing a straight stitch down the side of the mask", 544.8, 563.839], ["so then once i take my pins out we are going to head back over to the iron because i want to flatten out the front of this mask so that the pleats are flattened and it has a crisper look and feel to it so that is all for the creation of the mask itself", 564.399, 583.839], ["we are done with that part and now we can move on to the matching carrying pouch slash bag so back to the cutting board this time we are going to be using the pattern fabric and then the dimensions for this that i use", 580.0, 596.64], ["are 8 inches by 5 inches", 591.92, 596.64], ["i like to cut one long piece and then fold it in half again", 594.959, 602.079], ["we want the right sides to be touching so since we did fold this piece of fabric in half one of the sides of the bag is already together so that is why are going to be sewing down the bottom of the bag now and the other side", 598.16, 612.9590000000001], ["and then when i get towards the end of this side i stop about an inch and a half maybe from the very top of the fabric and cut off my stitch there because we are going to need that extra fabric at the top to make our loop that our elastic is going to go in so

edges are equal", 628.0, 639.68], ["so now we are going to fold the fabric like this and then sew a straight stitch all the way down", 641.68, 650.24], ["and we are going to do this obviously on both sides", 646.64, 651.2], ["and then this will create the two flaps where we will be threading our elastic through", 648.32, 661.839], ["so at this point the sewing portion of this bag is complete so i am going to flip it", 662.16, 671.04], ["right side out", 667.04, 671.04], ["try and poke out the corners as best as i can there", 667.04, 675.92], ["she is", 671.04, 675.92], ["she is beautiful",

fabric on both sides", 678.48, 684.079], ["and then i extend it a little bit past the very end", 680.399, 688.0], ["i estimated that that would probably be about a 10 inch long piece of elastic",

gonna do that right now", 828.49, 835.54], ["because Bob is looks like it is blended nicely in mine is not so that is why think I physically put white in there and drag it", 830.62, 841.51], ["and

gonna use black to fill this in alright", 506.99, 518.539], ["so that is why am gonna wait for that to dry", 515.15, 520.4], ["then I am gonna take off the stencil and fix up the edges so then for

keep", 133.68, 155.84900000000002], ["so the rough cut is probably the most crucial part because you cut out everything you do not want that is really what you need to do first because then you have

the one that puts in the color wheel to make the effect", 703.17, 710.91], ["so this is the point in the video where I am gonna turn off my color greeting that I have had on this entire video so that

basically let is get freaking started", 721.54, 726.639], ["and I will try and give you guys a very compact explanation of how I did this to do this I dragged look grade layer on to my video and then

kind of like the second tip but different SOHO third tip for you guys", 283.81, 297.849], ["is to plan out your weeks so in my agenda like I said I write all my assignments down", 292.69, 301.659],

work ahead to like the following week and", 330.31, 336.56], ["I will look at what I have and I will allocate time in the current week for those future projects and assignments or whatever so that I can get this off my plate too", 333.789, 345.40999999999997], ["but basically the point is that I write down at the beginning of each week what I need to do every day to accomplish everything that I

pretty sure this is how correct me if I am wrong but", 236.18, 242.9], ["this is kind of what I figured out", 239.0, 244.49], ["so if you like in each of here like the red orange like all of these",

the colors if your Boop is you can play with the hue saturation and luminance of each individual color in your picture so like if you want blues to stick out more you can go into the blue colors and

that", 340.07, 345.38], ["is that you have done on your picture to that they are safe and you can use them on the rest of your pictures which is what I do obviously like", 342.11, 351.10999999999996],

go over to visco", 354.74, 359.99], ["I go in there", 357.8, 361.46000000000004], ["and then I upload the picture into that", 357.8, 365.06], ["and then I hit the edit button and then the preset from

the filter on Bisco and", 370.46, 379.71], ["then that is what it looks like after", 375.93, 379.71], ["so then if I am happy with that I will just save it", 377.789, 384.38899999999995], ["but if I want to tweak the saturation or like literally do anything of that nature it will tweak it like", 379.71, 387.96000000000004], ["just the smallest bit like I put it up plus 0 1", 386.219, 392.339],

i think is super cute actually", 361.94, 377.81], ["so then it looks like this is it for the second one literally so freaking easy sweating to this next one", 371.21, 386.12], ["is like a variation of what I do pretty much all the time I am always saying like the half up half down with a braided top part", 379.82, 393.44000000000005], ["I guess you could not is that what it is called no definitely not gonna try this if I completely fail", 388.97, 400.04], ["then I am gonna do the regular one because I have not done a braid like this in a hot second", 395.57, 405.53000000000003], ["but you know it is worth a try", 403.01, 408.77], ["basically this is a what is it called a Dutch French braid instead of doing a regular French braid where you go over the pieces to do it", 403.01, 418.16], ["you go underneath this", 412.73, 418.16], ["gets a little tricky", 416.27, 419.53999999999996], ["I do not know I used to be good at this", 416.27, 421.43], ["but then I just stopped doing and", 418.16, 423.94], ["I stopped being good at it", 419.54, 423.94], ["you", 435.169, 437.229], ["oh I did it basically with a dutch french braid", 438.639, 448.96], ["um it makes the braid kind of like pop out more on the top which I really like", 443.5, 456.0], ["so then once I am done with that part I take a hair tie and throw the back part up and a bun obviously then", 448.96, 465.819], ["fix it cause it looks trash when I first do it", 459.75, 473.039], ["and I like to pull the braid", 462.37, 476.469], ["so it looks Messier", 465.819, 476.469], ["and then if I need to which I typically do I will take bobby pins again and fix my bun literally looks like this I say literally way too much", 465.819, 505.97999999999996], ["and I like to pull out pieces in the front to just ends up looking like this obviously", 502.2, 510.96000000000004], ["the easier version of this would be a regular French braid back and then putting it in a bun", 505.98, 516.09], ["but I like the way that the Dutch one looks I just think it looks Messier and the braid kind of pops out more on the top as you guys can see", 513.27, 523.68], ["I mean this obviously is not the best upgrade in the world because I really feel like I have not done one in a couple of years because I gave up on it because I suck that so bad", 520.53, 532.5300000000001], ["so then this is what is this the third hairstyle", 527.34, 535.7099999999999], ["ok", 532.53, 535.7099999999999], ["so then this is the next one I realized that I actually picked a lot of hairstyles with Dutch French braids", 532.53, 542.55], ["so basically this is just gonna be one that kind of goes across the side or the front of your head the side", 537.15, 551.7], ["hello and a layer some hair over it", 546.0, 554.73], ["I think let is get started starting my braids kind of farther than my actual part is doing a Dutch one again", 547.98, 566.25], ["so that is why are gonna instead of going over top like in a normal French braid", 557.79, 574.2], ["we are gonna hold the hair underneath the goal of this I think is to get it looking friggin thick", 566.25, 582.4200000000001], ["so I like to use a lot of hair", 576.83, 584.25], ["wow", 576.83, 584.25], ["this is like way easier right now than what I just did so", 576.83, 594.3190000000001], ["then once you get to about this point membranes basically done so that is why am gonna tie it off back here with a hair tie a while I am gonna end up pinning it because I feel like it looks cleaner if I do not have a hair tie sitting there or just wanting to sit that there", 587.98, 611.0290000000001], ["so that is why can work with it a little bit", 606.589, 613.999], ["and then what I like to do is again pull the braid undone", 607.999, 620.3290000000001], ["then we are gonna go to work with the bobby pins", 613.999, 625.0999999999999], ["and I am gonna pin the crap out of this", 617.54, 627.699], ["so it literally does not move then", 620.329, 636.649], ["once I have it pinned down to where I feel like it is not going to move", 632.209, 640.779], ["I will take out the hair tie mess it up a little bit more and then kind of drape some more hair like over it so that the braid and the bobby pins are hidden underneath there because you do not want to see those it is not cute", 634.79, 663.889], ["is the fourth hairstyle I think and moving on to the next one is involving braids again", 656.899, 670.999], ["next one looks like this it is a braided crown", 663.889, 672.139], ["so that is why am not really sure how I want to go about this", 667.04, 675.379],

leave it there for right now", 685.92, 693.98], ["and I am going to do it the other side then", 688.46, 708.97], ["once this side is done we are gonna do the same thing and tie it off", 704.03, 711.98], ["then we are done", 708.97, 719.36], ["then what I am gonna do is take each side and pull it a lot like a lot", 708.97, 721.8100000000001], ["and then I am gonna take both of the hair ties out and then bring them both back around the back side of my head this", 726.28, 745.6], ["I do not have enough hair to connect them with a hair ties so that is why am going to bobby", 739.77,

little baby hairs in the front", 760.62, 776.15], ["then I am going to use more bobby pins because I messed up and there are any other weird parts bobby pin in those too", 770.16, 783.8900000000001], ["okay", 788.1, 794.19], ["then this is that hairstyle", 788.1, 794.19], ["I really like this actually this one definitely required the most bobby pins out of all of them because I kept messing up last hairstyle", 788.1, 802.1999999999999], ["it looks like this", 797.67, 804.5100000000001], ["it is a messy bun with a braid up the back which I like to do I am going to be doing a French braid you can do a Dutch one if you want to", 799.32, 810.63], ["but I am gonna do about the other one", 806.16, 813.15], ["so you have to braid up the back of your hair", 808.14, 823.23], ["so that is why am gonna flip over my hair", 813.15, 826.2299999999999], ["then I am putting all the hair together and I am doing a normal messy bun", 814.92, 832.8000000000001], ["I always do my messy buns like this",
