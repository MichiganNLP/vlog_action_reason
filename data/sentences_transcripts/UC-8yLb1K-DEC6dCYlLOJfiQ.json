portant to go and also as you go on and accomplish stuff you can check stuff off which will make you feel more efficient and on top of your game and it can also inspire you to get more things done so my second tip is to add kindness and positive vibes to your to do list because so that is why it is hard to bring yourself down when you are stressed and it will let you focus on your task more it will also add a brighter outlook to your day and it will make you feel awesome inside and feel like you can do anything so my next tip is to declutter your life and make te having way too many things to do can cause so much unwanted stress in your life and can make you feel overwhelmed frustrated and depressed", 83.56, 163.06], ["but there is a sple way to avoid all of that start by teaching
