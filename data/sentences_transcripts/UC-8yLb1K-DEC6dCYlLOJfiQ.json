will be much faster", 259.47, 266.43], ["but the reason for that is imagine you have a knot", 262.47, 268.46999999999997], ["okay", 264.419, 268.46999999999997], ["so imagine you are tying your

make it way harder to get out", 283.02, 290.099], ["and you are gonna end up breaking your hair", 285.78, 291.84000000000003], ["and if you are trying to get some knots out of your hair when it is wet

in", 154.89, 163.65], ["and then the insulin will go right into my body and work like a pancreas so basically it is a mechanical pancreas that is outside of your body and my pump is always attached to

foods are very high in glucose and some foods are very fatty", 242.89, 252.28], ["so that is why will come in a lot later and the last thing is hormones I am a teenager and hormones that is a huge part of my life", 248.53, 258.25], ["so when my hormones are acting up I do usually get a little bit of wonky blood sugars but those are the four main things that will make it hard for me to match my
