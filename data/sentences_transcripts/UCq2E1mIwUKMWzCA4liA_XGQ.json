artisans or from thrift stores and antique shops which is actually where we have gotten the majority of our props from just because you can get some really characteristic and beautiful pieces that

yellowish and that does not look visually appealing of course you can also play with light in terms of whether it is going to be front lit side lit or backlit shots front lit shots means that you are standing in between the light source and the hero that means your hero is going to be completely lit and this results in a more bright and airy photo side lit shots add really nice contrast because there is areas that are light in areas that are dark creates a little bit of depth a little bit of moodiness which is quite beautiful and then backlit shots are quite moody so play around with it and

more compact and affordable", 123.0, 127.17], ["then I can recommend the one that we use at home which is this one the Ninja Blender the reason we chose this blender for the house", 125.28, 136.42],

Vitamix", 134.32, 141.28], ["you can see what I mean it is shorter", 139.39, 143.82999999999998], ["it is also a lot leaner especially the base", 141.28, 147.58], ["it is also very reasonably priced especially considering what you get with it which in our case was two different kinds of blenders and a food processor but more on that later", 143.83, 155.02], ["and then the blending pitcher can also be popped off the base you can replace the blades with a drinking lid and then take it with you to go it is been really handy for those mornings when I have been in a rush", 153.1, 166.0], ["and I want to take something and wholesome with me", 162.64, 167.62], ["and I think of all of the blenders I have used this one is actually the easiest to clean because the blades are easily accessible all in all I feel like the blender is such a an essential kitchen appliance for me personally probably tied in first place with a food processor so the blender and the food processors look similar in that they have blades they blend up certain ingredients", 163.9, 190.78], ["but they do serve two totally different functions the blender is meant to blend things that are more liquid", 186.82, 195.13], ["well the food processor blends things that are a bit more labor intensive and usually semi solid", 192.19, 199.57], ["so these are for example making things like nut butters yourself at

is a really versatile machine", 207.88, 213.7], ["but you do want to be careful because when a recipe calls for a food processor you usually do not want to use a blender because like I said the blender needs liquid so if you add more solid foods to it like dates and nuts without the liquid not is", 210.04, 227.29], ["it probably not going to work", 223.48, 229.27], ["you also run the risk of breaking your blender in the process of trying I am gonna share three food processors with you today the first one being this Philips brand which is the one that you have probably seen us using a fair bit in different pickup lines videos", 225.459, 241.69], ["it is the first one that Robin and I bought together because it was affordable", 237.94, 246.37], ["but it is not super high quality", 241.69, 248.32], ["it also came with a blender for example and that one broke a couple weeks after we started using it", 243.76, 252.31], ["so a little while ago we switched to using this magic mix and I am", 250.06, 257.169], ["i absolutely love this one like the Vitamix", 252.31, 261.28], ["it is powerful", 257.169, 261.28], ["we made almond butter in it the other day", 257.169, 262.36999999999995], ["and it took half the time as our previous food processor did", 259.78, 266.12], ["and it is a lot more quiet as well", 262.37, 268.25], ["and another perk to this guy is that it has three separate compartments depending on the volume of the things that you want to blend so for example the smaller compartment you could use to chop things like onions or to make salsa and then the bigger compartment you could use to make things like nut butters and it also comes with these accessory components that you can then use to quickly shred things like carrots or beets or cabbages that you can then use in salads or nourish rolls", 264.26, 294.28999999999996], ["so it is handy for food prep if you want to shred a whole bunch of things all at once in a few seconds like the Vitamix it is on the pricier side", 290.419, 300.32], ["but there are different models and they come at different price ranges depending on what you are looking for the other thing you might want to consider", 297.74, 307.76], ["is that it does take up a considerable amount of counter space and at home we do not have any counter space at all so at home", 303.8, 314.96], ["we use the ninja food processor which again came together as a unit with the blender on the upside it is compact", 310.31, 321.77], ["and it is affordable but on the downside it can be a bit small in terms of capacity and it is not as powerful as the magic mix", 317.03, 327.71], ["like I do not think I would feel comfortable making something like a nut butter in this", 326.24, 333.169], ["I am afraid it might break namely", 329.419, 335.03], ["I use it at home to make a small batch of hummus each week and that is good enough for us", 330.919, 340.4], ["so if I could summarize I definitely recommend a food processor as much if not maybe even more than a blender given how versatile it is", 335.03, 347.9], ["and I would recommend going for higher wattage whenever you can because it does mean it is gonna be a bit more powerful at blending things like nuts and seeds", 345.68, 355.36999999999995], ["and if I could go back to my younger self", 353.15, 360.11], ["I think I would say invest in getting a good one once because then you are gonna use it for years", 355.37, 363.44], ["and it is gonna make your life in the kitchen so much more enjoyable and easy next up is the hand blender", 360.11,

how it works is that there is three components to this one component", 374.93, 383.6], ["is usually the immersion blender which is what we namely use to puree soups one other component that could come with it", 379.16, 389.09000000000003], ["is a whisk which we have used to make things like our coconut width and finally and my favorites is the mini food processor as I call it", 385.97, 397.82],

this all in one device with these three features and it is super useful across the board", 399.95, 411.08], ["it is really small", 407.15, 413.24], ["it hardly takes up any space and it is also easy to clean especially if you do not want to clean this huge food processor when you only need to make a small amount of something and the whole set for the most part tends to be affordable no matter where you find it", 409.55, 425.72], ["so when it comes to downsides honestly I ca not think of anything I definitely definitely recommend these so this is pretty much all we have in terms of appliances at both the studio and at our house a blender a food processor and", 421.73, 440.15], ["a hand blender three things pretty minimal and for me personally all pretty essential", 435.38,

to visualize what the ideal you would do in that particular situation", 142.94, 149.07999999999998], ["And the most important thing here is to remember that the ideal you is consistent in their
