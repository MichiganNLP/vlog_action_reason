am going to make a little hole put two seeds in there then cover the hole", 401.0, 408.65], ["and I am going to do the same", 405.44, 408.65], ["and then I am going to continue to do this with each

this one because it was confusing enough as it was to try to figure it out", 179.4, 193.35], ["I was a little worried because using on the Internet so hopefully between what I put in the description in this video you can then figure out how to do this because it is pretty cool and", 189.78, 200.67], ["I think it looks pretty neat", 198.959, 202.23], ["I am taking a piece of twine and wrapping it

side", 313.889, 321.699], ["and then I am going to pull back the other side", 319.419, 325.629], ["and I am going to go ahead and start with some tacky glue or some Elmer", 321.699,

am taking a basket", 431.63, 439.25], ["I am going to kind of try to make this silar to for a reference", 434.66, 443.69], ["and then I got this rope on sale", 439.25, 446.39000000000004], ["so it was

your garden and grab a bunch of goodies from your garden you can use this basket for that", 510.71, 523.1], ["but as you can see here I am continuing to glue and go round and round and round until I finish the basket then", 518.66, 548.92], ["when you are all finished you have this beautiful basket", 544.62, 550.84], ["so it is a little te consuming", 546.64, 552.67], ["but I think it is so

going to take that and loop them together like this so that is why am going to put one piece through the other piece", 643.24, 655.12], ["and you can put it on your head one of two ways you can either tie it at the top into like a little knot or a little", 649.93, 663.55], ["bow", 658.63, 663.55], ["and that is fun", 658.63, 663.55], ["kind of like for around the house or if you you know want to be

these ones are extremely sple and easy to make but also effective", 3.389, 15.059], ["and we are focusing on two different ingredients as the base of these DIY beauties so that is why have aloe vera and coconut oil", 10.62, 22.32], ["and we are going to be making a bunch of different things with those two ingredients", 18.06, 27.119], ["so let is start first with DIY beauty using aloe vera", 22.32, 33.09], ["we are going to be making a super easy aloe vera body wash", 27.119, 35.129999999999995], ["so that is why am basically upgrading a body wash that I already used because I use castile soap in my shower right now", 30.81, 41.099999999999994], ["this is the lavender castile soap I get at Whole Foods", 36.66, 44.82], ["I love it", 41.1, 44.82], ["I get it in the economy size and put them in little jars on my shower if you watched my turn your bathroom into a spa video", 41.1, 50.879000000000005], ["I talked a little bit about that", 47.34, 53.28], ["so we are upgrading this shower", 50.879, 57.3], ["gel I am adding 1 4 of a cup of aloe vera to a half of a cup of the castile soap and then I am going to be adding some vitamin E 1tsp of vitamin E and mixing that together", 50.879, 69.99], ["and then you can pour that into a large container or a small container in this case I have this little container so that is why am putting it into a travel sized container so that is why am going to use a funnel you can make a big batch or a smaller batch", 65.64, 84.03], ["but again this kind of upgrades a body wash", 78.18, 85.58999999999999], ["and it did suds up nice", 80.85,

is great for the skin", 91.11, 97.35], ["so that is why am using this on a natural sea sponge these are biodegradable sponges that you can also find at most health food stores or you can find them online", 93.96, 105.29899999999999], ["you can buy them in bulk if you want", 101.52, 107.78999999999999], ["but this is a great body wash and if you are in a pinch you can use it as a shampoo as well", 103.079, 115.47], ["so it kind of doubles as those next we are going to be making a facial cleanser for the facial cleanser", 110.759, 123.58999999999999], ["you need three ingredients you are going to do equal parts aloe vera gel sweet almond oil and", 119.71, 128.96], ["then one or two drops of tea tree oil so", 126.74, 133.82000000000002], ["this is more of like an oil cleanser but the tea tree oil is actually great for acne", 128.96, 137.87], ["and it is an antiseptic on the skin and have antiseptic properties so it is great for the skin overall and it can help soothe the skin and reduce redness and acne breakouts and things like that", 133.82, 149.98999999999998], ["so you can use this as a facial cleanser", 147.74, 152.78], ["one or two drops is plenty because tea tree oil is

all you need is two parts water and one part aloe vera", 165.65, 181.34], ["so that is why am putting the aloe vera", 175.85, 183.56], ["actually I have a little straw here", 179.18, 185.39000000000001], ["and I am putting the aloe vera in the water", 181.34, 187.34], ["and then I am going to shake that up", 183.56, 190.67], ["and that makes a nice setting spray or facial toner",

of the skin afterwards let is move on to another favorite ingredient which is coconut oil I ve shown how you can put coconut oil in your hair and on your scalp which makes a great beauty treatment",

why have fourth of a cup of organic cold pressed coconut oil 1 tablespoon of beeswax", 216.989, 228.36], ["and I am basically going to heat that over a double boiler I ve shown this process on my channel multiple tes", 221.549, 234.66], ["but basically you have a pan with hot water", 230.64, 238.11], ["and then a bowl on top of that pan that is ok to get heated obviously", 234.66, 243.15], ["and I am going to melt the coconut oil and the beeswax together coconut oil melts much faster than beeswax", 238.11, 250.44], ["so that is why have to be patient and wait for the beeswax", 246.42, 252.93], ["and then I pull it off", 248.31, 255.239], ["wait for it to cool down and add 1 4 TSP of vitamin E oil", 250.44, 257.82], ["and then I am going to add that into a lip balm jar or two in this case", 252.93, 261.81], ["I was going to take a funnel and gently pour the mixture into the lip balm jars close them up", 257.82, 267.18], ["and then go ahead and let those harden", 261.81, 270.29999999999995], ["and you have a easy and very effective all purpose balm you can add essential oils if you want to", 264.78, 278.58], ["but I liked it sple like this you can throw this in your bag once it is had a chance to harden up after about 6 to 8 hours and you can use this for your lips for dry elbows you can even use it for scars you can pretty much use it for anything for cuticles it works great for the ends of your hair to prevent split", 273.87, 301.08], ["ends it kind of does everything", 294.81, 303.65999999999997], ["so next we are making a moisturizing and healing face mask", 296.76, 306.71999999999997], ["so this doubles as a face mask and a moisturizer so after you use this you do not need to use a moisturizer if you do not want to so for this we are adding equal parts honey and coconut oil", 301.08, 315.87], ["I am going to mix it well and incorporate the two together if you have oily prone skin", 314.52, 323.31], ["you may not like this", 318.419, 323.31],

test on the side of your skin and see how it feels", 323.31, 334.04999999999995], ["but I am going to mix that together well and apply that onto my skin after I use this like I said I personally did not feel like I needed a moisturizer", 330.78, 345.96000000000004], ["so that is why applied that after a shower left it on for 15 to 20 minutes and then washed it with a little water next", 340.41, 352.889], ["we are making three different body scrubs the first one I like to call oatmeal cookie so that is why am kind of eyeballing this", 347.909, 360.72], ["I have equal part outs that I ground up in a food processor I have some brown sugar I am going to add some coconut oil mix", 355.56, 367.74], ["that together this is the most wonderful scrub it smells divine and", 365.34, 374.69899999999996], ["it is extremely hydrating", 369.84, 374.69899999999996], ["so I actually use this on my legs", 369.84, 376.91900000000004], ["but I also used it on my bellies I like to",

far", 380.669, 388.169], ["my favorite next", 382.65, 388.169], ["I am making a banana bread scrub if you do not like the feel of banana you may not like this and banana is used for hair masks and all

up a half of a banana adding some coconut oil and then adding some sugar you can add brown sugar if you want", 399.15, 411.63], ["but in this case I am adding a little bit of white sugar", 408.539,

413.789, 425.219], ["so if you have sensitive skin that might be more appropriate and then next we are making a matcha green tea scrub I am adding equal parts Epsom salt", 420.27, 434.099], ["some matcha powder a little bit of baking soda", 430.56, 440.52], ["and I am also going to add some coconut oil", 434.099, 442.889], ["and I am going to mix this all together so that I have my green tea

body wash so scrub with it and then use a body wash", 447.75, 459.09000000000003], ["this one is definitely this strong", 455.43, 461.009], ["it", 457.529, 461.009], ["well I would say the oatmeal cookie is definitely a strong scrub as well but", 457.529, 465.899], ["the Epsom salt makes this one pretty strong to clarify when I say strong", 461.009, 469.84], ["I mean abrasive", 465.899,

different ingredients if you have sensitive skin", 465.899, 484.18], ["but the green tea is great for anti aging and this is a good scrub I liked this one and again I used it before my body wash and

have some rosemary which I got from my garden", 285.71, 291.169], ["but you can use dried rosemary if you d like and then again I am using the oatmeal that has been through the food processor so it is
