was like 90 to 100 degrees on this day", 17.31, 26.849], ["so that is why was in shorts and getting work done", 20.46, 30.119], ["but we are kind of prepping for fall not in the garden and for what we are gonna grow but just all around the yard", 22.8, 36.719], ["I thought I would show you what I am up to today which chores are always different depending on the day and the week in the month", 32.82, 44.370000000000005], ["but this was what I was doing today", 39.899, 46.35], ["so on our property we grow food in different areas", 42.21, 51.149], ["we have about 3 acres under 3 acres", 46.35, 53.25], ["it is all gated in", 49.26, 53.25], ["but we have an inner and outer portion of our property", 49.26, 55.92], ["so the inner portion is kind of like a more traditional backyard where we have grass and then we have our culinary garden in our herb garden this area", 53.25, 66.81], ["right here is", 64.799, 68.7], ["it is on kind of the outskirts of our property", 64.799, 69.96000000000001], ["it is next to the chicken coop", 66.81, 72.119], ["so it is a little farther away from the house", 68.7, 74.00999999999999], ["we also did not have garden beds for this area so what we did was we prepped the soil we used our compost", 69.96, 81.27000000000001], ["and we did some tilling and turning and prepping it this season before", 76.049, 86.369], ["and then we did large lines and experimented with watermelons squash zucchini and pumpkins", 81.27, 91.59], ["we had much better luck this year with pumpkins", 86.369, 93.08999999999999], ["than we did last year we had no luck with pumpkins last year", 89.82, 97.77000000000001], ["but this year we got about six or seven large pumpkins", 93.09, 99.36], ["and then we got these small white ones which they are all edible", 95.1, 103.57], ["you can cook them the same way you would cook squash", 99.36, 106.28], ["I am gonna use them to decorate", 103.57, 107.57], ["and then once I feel like it is time", 103.57, 108.95], ["I am gonna pull them and use them to cook with them", 106.28, 111.86], ["so this is an example of kind of the rabbits eating away at the pumpkin so they are not perfect looking but that pumpkin looked pretty nice", 108.95, 119.09], ["and then I got a cool green pumpkin and", 115.79, 120.77], ["then lots of watermelon we got over a hundred pounds of zucchini so that is why were eating and donating and sharing a lot of zucchini", 117.14, 127.53999999999999], ["so today the plan was to pick whatever was left over so that is why got a nice little harvest we picked everything", 128.47, 137.86999999999998], ["and then we just wanted to mow all the vines and everything that was left over before we did that we had to move the irrigation", 132.95, 143.81], ["so we are kind of moving the vines and everything out of the way of the irrigation", 141.53, 148.52], ["then we are gonna move that then we are gonna let the chickens come over and enjoy whatever they want there is um lots of little bugs and little leftovers for them to enjoy", 145.22, 159.23], ["so they are gonna go at it for a few hours", 154.1, 162.2], ["and then once they do that we have all the leftovers that go into the compost and", 159.23, 169.31], ["the compost is what we use as soil to feed not our garden beds our pots anytime we want to grow anything we have a rich compost that we have been working on for the last few years", 163.79, 177.20000000000002], ["so we are adding to that", 174.47, 179.03], ["and then we can also use that in this area come spring when we begin to plant seeds for what we want to grow in the spring", 174.47, 186.17], ["so right here you can see us moving the irrigation and over to the right there", 182.66, 191.20899999999997], ["we are starting to grow a few trees we have maybe about eight trees right now", 186.17, 195.38], ["and we are kind of experimenting with the beginning of an orchard going up the hill when the chickens are out free ranging that is a good time for me to clean the coop which needs to be cleaned out every few weeks", 191.209, 272.5], ["it definitely starts to smell and attract flies", 267.4, 274.12], ["I am gonna collect the eggs", 269.68, 276.46], ["and then I am gonna clean out all the hay that is inside of the chicken coop right now which also has a lot of poop", 272.5, 283.0], ["and we have these little containers that they lay in so", 278.74, 284.56], ["that is why go in there every morning", 280.66, 287.139], ["and they sit in there", 283.0, 287.139], ["and they lay their eggs and then they kind of let you know", 283.0, 290.98], ["like I finished laying my eggs um", 287.139, 292.38899999999995], ["and then they go out", 288.46, 292.38899999999995], ["so all of them are out free ranging right now", 288.46, 294.91], ["so I am taking all the old hay and the chicken poop with it", 292.389, 299.83000000000004], ["this is actually really great for your compost because it is rich with", 294.91, 305.44], ["nitrogen chicken poop is awesome for compost which ends up being what you use for soil for continuing to grow anything in the future so none of this goes to waste it all gets used to continue to grow and in terms of the eggs we get about a dozen eggs a day some days more some days less", 299.83, 324.729], ["and we donate we have been selling them to local food trucks", 321.01, 329.2], ["my husband has a few chef friends that like to buy farm fresh eggs", 324.729, 333.58], ["we consume them as well and give them to family and friends and then sometimes we feed them back to the chickens it kind of depends on how many you have I am putting fresh hay inside of the chicken coop", 329.2, 343.57], ["which is what I do every time I clean it out", 339.669, 344.95], ["so there is no more poop in there", 341.83, 347.55], ["it is all fresh hay", 343.57, 349.99], ["I cleaned out their little laying baskets and put fresh hay in there", 344.95, 353.95], ["and it is all ready to go", 349.99, 353.95], ["I d say this takes me an average of like a half an hour to get it nice and clean", 349.99, 358.09], ["and then it smells so much better", 355.81, 359.87], ["and it is ready to go so", 355.81, 373.0], ["this portion right here is the inner portion of our backyard", 367.89, 374.29], ["and I think I have shared in previous videos that my husband extended the fence line to make room for our garden", 370.3, 381.43], ["and then he has like a little thin fence up to prevent rabbits from completely destroying it", 376.36, 386.05], ["so the fence was previously right where the garden starts so that is why can see the little area where the garden starts that was where the fence was before and now it is behind the garden and when we first moved into this house we did have kind of like gardeners who would come and just mow the lawn and clean up leaves and things that have shed from the trees", 381.43, 402.34], ["but as we kind of started doing this more ourself we ended up deciding to do the chores ourselves on the weekend", 400.45, 409.54], ["so Byron always mows the lawn every weekend", 406.24, 410.41999999999996], ["and we clean up the tree trimmings once again everything that we clean up gets used somehow on our property so with the grass we use it as mulch and also with the tree trimming so like the eucalyptus tree", 407.77, 436.71999999999997], ["we have a few different compost piles so that is why have been starting to build different piles for different areas of the property", 432.4, 444.21999999999997], ["so that is why have like a mulch pile", 438.789, 446.47], ["we have our traditional compost so everything kind of gets reused nothing gets thrown away", 442.12, 451.87], ["and recently we actually had all of our trees trimmed", 449.169, 457.18], ["and so that is why have this pile here of all the wood chippings which work great for around the property as mulch", 451.87, 464.349], ["and then you can see all of the leaves that drop from the trees that it ends up all over our back porch", 458.86, 469.12], ["so we kind of blow it into a pile and then pick it up and clean it up and put it into our compost or into our mulch pile both of us were raised in Southern California", 464.349, 490.71], ["neither of us were raised on property so this is kind of new to us and something we have grown to learn and love and during the summer", 485.7, 498.03], ["Byron and I definitely do our fair share of chores in flip flops and sandals things will start to cool down a little bit", 493.02, 504.33], ["and of course we wear boots and depending on where we are working certain areas of the property", 501.09, 511.02], ["we pretty much do wear boots just because it is a little safer in terms of critters and anything that could be stepped on but", 507.12, 518.85], ["so right now we are in sandals cleaning up the inner and outer portion of the property", 513.63, 523.23], ["and this we actually have not seen we have seen one snake on our property the entire time we have lived here", 520.59, 529.08], ["and it was a non venomous snake", 524.97, 530.67], ["so that is why have yet to see one", 526.41, 533.2800000000001], ["but that is always a possibility as well", 529.08, 535.4699999999999], ["so that is why am cleaning up everything that he blew into a pile I am just picking it up", 530.67, 540.1800000000001], ["and I am gonna carry it on over to the back of the property where we have our little mulch", 535.47, 549.51], ["pile the last thing that I have to get done today is cleaning out the chairs and the table that we have out in front of our herb garden which we did a lot of summer dinners outside", 540.18, 562.65], ["normally I would put this away but we do not have harsh winters here obviously in Southern California", 556.92, 568.38], ["we do get some rain", 564.12, 568.38], ["but these are weatherproof and they need a good cleaning every few weeks to every few months", 564.12, 573.5400000000001], ["kind of depends", 570.84, 573.5400000000001], ["I keep an eye on it and if we are eating out there more consistently", 570.84, 577.4399999999999], ["I am obviously keeping it clean", 573.54, 578.76], ["we are gonna extend it", 575.55, 578.76], ["right now we are adding the inner piece to extend it which this was last year", 577.44, 583.14], ["I put this away in our Shack", 578.76, 584.3100000000001], ["and then we brought it out in this summer", 581.46, 586.71], ["and we had a bunch of summer dinners so it is still pretty warm", 583.14, 589.9200000000001], ["so that is why might have a few more dinners before it starts the rainy season", 586.71, 594.54], ["and then I am gonna treat it with mineral oil and that is gonna keep the table looking nice for a long time we have had this table for a while", 589.92, 600.12], ["and it is held up really nice especially for an outdoor table", 597.51, 603.5], ["so I usually wipe and wash", 605.43, 611.019], ["and then I am going to dry it", 605.43, 612.76], ["then I am gonna add the mineral oil", 608.95, 615.82], ["I use the mineral oil that we use for our cutting boards and again that helps it makes it look like a brand new table this table", 611.019, 621.7900000000001], ["I got", 617.44, 621.7900000000001], ["a lot of you asked me", 617.44, 623.68], ["I got it at kind of like a local back", 620.05, 626.079],

of you who are interested it was a local store", 626.079, 636.8199999999999], ["and we got this table", 632.17, 639.279], ["and it is held up", 634.81, 639.279], ["really well I love the lanterns I kind of move those around depending on the time of the year usually in the fall", 634.81, 644.279], ["I will move them to the front of the house for winter for Christmas time", 642.94, 650.26], ["but I like one on the table with a candle I usually put some type of bug repellant candle because usually when we are out there having dinners during the summertime we have a lot of flies and bugs and things like that", 644.279, 694.039], ["so so that completes today is video", 656.98, 701.17], ["I have had so many requests specifically to see how I clean the chicken coop but also just kind of updates on what we are growing and kind of what my routine looks like in terms of chores", 696.12, 712.45], ["so that is why wanted to share with you guys", 708.73, 714.5500000000001], ["and I hope

that on occasion but", 25.14, 36.12], ["for the most part I keep my routine pretty simple so today I am gonna share with you what that kind of looks like on any given day", 31.77, 47.608999999999995], ["so that is why am gonna start first with my morning routine which consists of a few steps the first being to wash my face a very simple routine of cleansing your skin morning and night", 37.769, 59.37], ["makes a huge difference and of course if you have a cleanser", 55.589, 60.87], ["you really like which", 57.629, 62.968999999999994], ["I like this one from fresh I have been using it on and off for years", 59.37, 67.17], ["I kind of change it up depending on what my skin is feeling", 62.969, 70.619], ["but this one is a nice gentle cleanser", 64.47, 72.03], ["and I mean there is been times where I do not wash my face morning at night because especially those years when my kids were newborn", 67.17, 80.13], ["I felt like I was in a fog", 76.17, 80.13], ["and I was not getting good sleep", 76.17, 83.399], ["so that is why am sure my routines suffered", 78.24, 86.369], ["but I do try to keep a consistent morning and evening cleansing routine which I think again I brush my teeth",

been using lately I there is a few kind of different serums I reach for either a vitamin C serum which I really like because that brightens the skin and that is nice always kind of reach for one of those", 93.99, 114.96000000000001], ["or I will reach for one that has peptides in it like Matrixyl 3000", 109.53, 120.479], ["there is these different peptides that you can find in serums that are supposed to be anti aging", 114.96, 125.52], ["and you know help your skin kind of heal itself if you will", 120.479, 128.94], ["so my friend actually is an aesthetician he is been on my channel

it running in the summer", 102.789, 109.44999999999999], ["the only downside about a humidifier is that you have to clean it out every few days I clean mine out with a little bit of vinegar and

to include kids on Oliver", 45.36, 53.13], ["was at school when I did this so that is why was not there to help me out with this project", 49.32, 56.46], ["but normally I would have him help me trace and cut", 54.48, 61.68], ["and you know help me out with the project", 56.46, 63.15], ["so that is why have a few more projects I am gonna save and do with him", 59.55, 65.07], ["but my mom always used to go crazy during the fall months and get us all involved in decorating", 63.15, 70.71], ["and she is a teacher", 66.72, 74.07], ["so it was always a really fun time during this time of the year I started by tracing the leaf and then cut out the leaf", 68.729, 85.45], ["and then I saved the canned pumpkin or the can from the canned pumpkin in my fall recipes video", 79.93, 89.98], ["I washed that out", 87.46, 91.75], ["and then I am gonna go ahead and paint this again painting the can", 87.46, 94.99], ["is another good way to get kids involved", 91.75, 98.25], ["it is fun so if you want to make this like a family project I am mixing three different colors orange red and a little bit of black to make it a nice maroon color you can of course paint it", 93.13, 115.109], ["any color you prefer", 111.39, 115.109], ["also there is a lot of different ways to have fun decorating with these you could even use a a larger can or a bucket or pail of some type and do this you could put several of these along a walkway and put like a fake candle inside so that when people walk up to your door during the fall months it is you know it is like a cool look", 113.069, 136.319], ["I am just making one of these", 133.17, 138.299], ["I am gonna go ahead and put this in our guest bathroom", 135.06, 140.879], ["but again you could go crazy and make several of them once the paint is completely dry it is time to start drilling the holes around the edges of the leaf", 138.299, 151.47], ["so what I am doing here now is", 146.43, 151.47], ["I have my drill", 146.43, 153.54], ["and I have a small drill bit", 149.31, 156.48], ["and I am gonna put tiny little holes all around the edges of the traced leaf now", 151.47, 161.79], ["the reason I did not use an actual leaf or a fake leaf directly on the can is because it is a little trickier to put holes into that", 156.48, 169.61999999999998], ["so I traced out a leaf on paper I made sure to tape that onto the can", 163.89, 173.88], ["and then this is the most", 169.62, 175.349], ["you know this is the hardest part of the project which is going around the edges to create little tiny holes all around the edges at this point I needed to do a few paint touch ups just to", 172.2, 185.069], ["it was nice and clean", 181.47, 185.069], ["and then I put a tea light in there", 183.0, 186.69], ["and then the light shines through I", 183.0, 188.13], ["just put this in my guest bathroom with a few other little decor pieces and then my favorite hand soap that I found from Trader Joe is it is their apple cider hand soap",

put a fake tea light in there because you get the same effect and you do not have to worry about it", 199.919, 209.549], ["it is a pretty like candle holder or tea light holder", 207.209, 214.109],

I wanted to make was scented pine cones I gave my son and his cousin is the job of going and finding me some pine cones from around the yard", 221.14, 234.04000000000002], ["I washed them", 229.93,

I d say three to five drops on each of them", 251.23, 257.35], ["keep in mind when you are using cinnamon essential oil to wash your hands after because if you touch your eyes with cinnamon essential

very strong essential oil so after a few drops on each of the pine cones", 265.78, 273.91], ["I am just gonna put that in a large glass container and this is nice to put in a bathroom as well because it just releases a beautiful scent into the air and instead of having to buy these they are easy to make", 270.49, 285.94], ["so I made some scented pine cones I put that on my fireplace with a fairy tale pumpkin once I start using the fireplace I will probably move it into one of the bathrooms", 281.919, 315.42999999999995], ["and then I started to decorate the mantel", 310.09, 317.53000000000003], ["so normally I will do the front door or I will decorate other areas of the house", 312.79, 322.78], ["but this year I started with a mantel", 317.53, 325.06], ["and I got this wreath on sale at Hobby Lobby", 318.97, 326.67999999999995], ["but I felt like it was", 322.78, 326.67999999999995], ["it was definitely in the fall section", 322.78, 328.12], ["but I felt like it could go as a Christmas wreath", 325.06, 332.26], ["it is pretty neutral so that is why wanted to add to it", 328.12, 333.96999999999997], ["so that is why took some elements from the yard I feel like I use eucalyptus for everything", 330.4, 337.24], ["but it is because I have it in my yard", 333.97, 339.7], ["so it is just easy to go to", 335.65, 341.86], ["I decided to put that all around the wreath to add some color", 337.24, 344.58000000000004], ["you", 345.95, 348.01], ["I also added some of these white pumpkins that I got at Hobby Lobby and inserted that into the wreath as well", 354.4, 362.05], ["so what I like about this wreath is that I could have added colorful leaves onto it", 357.94, 365.8], ["you can customize it in any way that you wanted", 364.24, 369.55], ["but I wanted to make it a temporary customization so that I could also do that for winter", 365.8, 373.0], ["so I did not want to glue anything if you needed you could use a little twine to tie everything in there but", 369.55, 379.75], ["by inserting everything stayed and then the eucalyptus was kind of like falling out", 374.83, 382.66], ["so I wanted to I went in and kind of tucked it", 381.28,

with white pumpkins and our rustic pumpkins that we have", 409.389, 424.63], ["and we use year after year", 420.94, 426.19], ["and we decorate with them a little bit differently also", 423.099,

early enough", 448.62, 461.85], ["sometimes I will switch it out so that is why actually have a secondary wreath I can either use on the door", 458.43, 465.57000000000005], ["or here I got that from

to start bearing fruit I recommend becoming friendly with somebody at your local nursery and chatting with them and talking with them about how you can best take care of your trees and your plants and

to be feeding it more and I obviously fed which is using the fertilizer", 261.84, 272.22], ["another tip is to use neem oil check on the back of the neem oil for the amount that you want to mix with

I have these little jiffy strips here", 317.59, 324.46], ["I have some seed packets that you can get at a nursery Home Depot wherever you you know pretty much want I get organic seeds of the different

ask for when you go there", 336.31, 343.81], ["so that is why am going to fill up the little pods the little tray with the seed starting soil I am going to go ahead and add that", 339.85, 350.08],

two pods for each of the seeds now like I mentioned before these seed packets run anywhere from 1 to 250", 382.43, 395.35], ["so that is why can plant a significant amount of seed starters with this method and save a lot of money", 388.43, 401.0], ["so really you need two seeds per pod", 395.35, 403.13], ["so I am going to make a little hole put two seeds in there then cover the hole", 401.0,

start to see your little herbs start to sprout", 433.84, 444.52], ["so another option is to make potted herbs and DIY seed bombs", 438.82, 449.5], ["this is something I kept seeing kind of everywhere

those two knots that I am taking the two pieces of twine that are closest together going down an inch and then creating a knot", 136.22, 148.76], ["and again you just continue to do this all the way around", 144.17, 152.75], ["I have seen a bunch of these all over the internet and people do them different", 152.75, 159.20999999999998], ["but I will show you where I got this from where I learned

way around", 156.51, 173.76], ["and now I am getting to the end", 170.22, 175.82999999999998], ["and I am going to have to connect the end piece all the way to the right with the end piece all the way

is start with the all purpose cleanser", 29.939, 35.25], ["this works for everything except for cleaning glass", 32.219, 38.339999999999996], ["so I am starting with 3 4 of a cup of water and then a quarter of a cup of alcohol rubbing alcohol", 35.25, 46.17], ["I have between 5 to 10 drops of lemon essential oil that you can use peppermint or orange whichever one you prefer", 40.52, 53.46], ["and then a few drops of natural dish soap", 47.61, 54.599999999999994], ["so that is why am going to mix this together", 50.37, 57.35], ["I am going to put this in a spray bottle so alcohol has not been approved by the FDA as far as disinfecting", 53.46, 67.17999999999999], ["but it does kill some bacteria and viruses it is not capable of killing like bacterial spores or anything like that", 60.94, 72.97], ["but if you use it in a cleanser like this on kitchen surfaces or things like that it will definitely help and this is a kitchen cloth I get these at Trader Joe", 69.28, 81.759], ["is so instead of using a bajillion paper towels which is kind of wasteful", 77.83, 90.07], ["I just use these", 81.759, 92.86], ["and then I wash them the next thing is a mild mold and mildew", 83.89, 96.06899999999999], ["remover now I say miles because Clorox is one of the things that can remove mold and there is all sorts of procedures if you have you know significant moles in your house",

some water tea tree oil and baking soda", 109.869, 117.22], ["and I am mixing that together", 113.259, 119.38000000000001], ["and then just spraying that on my shower or like little areas in my shower that I notice get kind of build up whether it is mold or mildew or build up in general", 115.959, 127.0], ["this works great", 125.41, 128.619], ["and then you can just use a toothbrush to kind of just scrub it and as you can see I had like a little green there", 125.41, 135.73], ["so whatever was there", 130.81, 135.73], ["is now gone", 133.15, 137.68], ["and I try to keep my eye out for that

stovetop cleaner", 141.28, 149.379], ["this is equal parts baking soda and olive oil and then you are going to put this on the area of your stove that kind of needs cleaning if you will", 143.5,

can even leave it overnight for tough stains", 159.099, 171.31], ["and then you can wash away using either vinegar or water so that is why am using water to wipe it away", 165.879,

have a flat stove so it is a little bit easier", 183.76, 190.56], ["I have had both I have had different types of stoves in my lifetime and this one is a little bit easier to clean", 187.959, 199.14],

paste when I open up the door of the oven", 220.77, 230.43], ["you can see", 225.959, 230.43], ["oh my gosh", 225.959, 231.81], ["the window is in desperate need of cleaning so that is why did a little section so you guys can see the results of how well this worked so that is why put it on", 228.209, 239.22], ["I let that fit for about a few hours", 234.45, 241.17], ["and then I came back with a pretty big brush", 236.76, 242.91], ["and I I had to put some elbow grease into it to definitely start to loosen up whatever was on there", 239.22, 251.79], ["and you can definitely see that it does clean up very well nothing works as good as this has worked because I have tried a few methods I am going to go over it", 245.73, 262.169], ["one more time obviously clean the whole thing and then go over it one more time", 258.87, 266.34], ["so it is extra clean but", 262.169, 266.34], ["that really really worked that was probably", 262.169, 268.44], ["my favorite one so good old baking soda really does the job so that cleaned up the oven", 264.9, 275.49], ["and then finally we are going to make a tub scrub I have made a variety of body scrubs on my channel", 270.57, 279.45], ["but I do not think I have ever made a tub scrub I am using baking soda salt and some natural dish soap", 275.49, 286.74], ["and I am creating a paste so I will put the exact ratio in the description", 282.3, 292.2], ["but this is a really easy way to clean your bathtub", 286.74, 295.74], ["and you can use it by itself with a you know some sort of paper towel or like what I was using those kind of microfiber wipes or if you want to go in a little bit more intense for the Polish you can use a brush", 288.93, 309.21], ["I also would recommend if you have jets inside your bathtub to have a toothbrush", 303.78, 313.68], ["and I mentioned this in my bathroom cleaning video if you are using scrubs or products in the bath in general things tend to get inside the Jets and it is important to clean those out", 309.21, 323.639], ["and I showed a few more ways to clean out your bathtub in that video but this scrub works well for just polishing up the bathtub cleaning all those Jets and the little areas and things like that or if it really needs a good scrub down and clean alright", 321.99, 341.25], ["so next we are moving into natural spring decor I wanted to show you guys a few things I am replanting this little cement container which I absolutely love I just love this look", 337.639, 351.84], ["I did a succulents in a smaller cement container in my how to make your bathroom look

it", 357.72, 365.15999999999997], ["and I use the rest of the succulents that I did have", 361.289, 369.87], ["so I use some of it for that I like to use this inside the house either as a centerpiece

to the grocery store", 397.62, 406.889], ["I like to mix and match a few different colors", 402.69, 408.96], ["and then I put those in mason jars I am doing two in this case", 404.58, 413.849], ["and it is easy", 408.96, 413.849], ["I mean if you have mason jars you have some lemons", 408.96, 417.18], ["and then you pick up some tulips you have a quick and easy centerpiece that looks very spring very summer", 413.849, 425.49], ["and you can also wrap the mason jars and burlap and that is also another cute way to liven up the centerpiece", 419.699, 430.919], ["and it is easy and again right away it just if you have people coming over or you want to make your house look vibrant and springy after you have cleaned it", 425.49, 441.24], ["I love this idea so that is why am taking a little bit of glue and gluing the burlap around the mason jar", 437.13, 445.889], ["it does not touch the mason jar so that is why can take it off if you want", 441.24, 450.57], ["but I think that that looks really cute and then finally wheatgrass is usually something you can get", 445.889, 455.4], ["and you can juice it does need to be referred", 450.57, 457.08], ["but if you have people coming over and you want kind of like a pop of color in your house I like to put wheatgrass in a container and put it on by the Sun in the windowsill", 455.4, 469.28900000000004], ["or you can plant it", 464.16,

that is a quick and easy thing", 472.8, 477.389], ["and then you put it in the refrigerator", 474.18, 479.07], ["and you can juice it and have wheatgrass shots so that is why can make wheatgrass shots

turning out pretty simple and easy and easy to remove", 95.61, 102.99000000000001], ["so your guests do not have to like pull it off the napkin or worry about it", 97.799, 107.1], ["this is pretty easy and also you can customize it with different colored ribbon", 102.99, 110.009], ["they had a few different colors at the dollar store and again you can have fun with it but creating easy napkin

pretty if you have a vase or two or three that you feel comfortable spray painting you can certainly do that", 149.11, 161.38], ["but you can also pick them up for a dollar a piece or you can use a wine bottle", 157.9, 165.64], ["and you can spray it with gold spray paint another cute idea which I did not do here", 161.38, 170.98], ["was you can take a stencil and have letters like Jo why joy

around my house and created like a little mini table scape so another idea this is a little bit more whimsical for putting your silverware on the table on top of the plates", 241.48, 270.09], ["is you can find these great little mini stockings at the dollar store", 266.52, 273.69], ["obviously you might want to wash them because they are kind of left out they are not like in a bag or anything so

really cute and again so easy", 280.47, 293.84999999999997], ["you can get I think it came with about six for a dollar so if you are going to be doing a really large table you might have to spend two

guest room and", 39.03, 44.849999999999994], ["people would come and we d have like blowup mattresses and things like that", 41.129, 48.059000000000005], ["so that is why would wing it", 44.85, 49.53], ["and I always dreamed of having a guest room to prepare for visitors because I genuinely enjoy the staging part of it and getting it ready before they come and obviously you always think of tidying up first and just getting it clean but above and beyond that", 46.44, 60.6], ["I like to make the room feel extra special for the holidays by dressing up the bedding adding colorful blankets and pillows and it is a quick and easy way to make it look festive now", 57.27, 69.299], ["I do not always get a chance to do this when guests come just depending on how much notice I am given before they come", 65.489, 75.42], ["but it is a nice touch to create a guest basket", 70.95, 77.90899999999999], ["so that is why can add water and a few yummy snacks and that is a great place to start", 72.72, 81.39], ["and then you can customize this with whatever else you want to add", 77.909, 85.32000000000001], ["so that is why can hit up the dollar store so it is not breaking the bank or grab some items from the Travel section at Target", 81.39, 91.079], ["usually they are all under three dollars and I put a few items", 87.0, 93.36], ["I think my guests might appreciate", 88.92, 95.1], ["and if I know that they have to do laundry", 91.079, 96.92999999999999], ["I will also add a few laundry items as well", 93.36, 101.43], ["I think it is a nice added touch someone did this for me once in my lifetime", 96.93, 104.909], ["and I remembered it", 101.43, 104.909], ["I mean I have remembered it my whole life", 103.29, 106.89], ["and I have always wanted to do it as often as I can when guests comment I", 104.909, 110.67], ["I feel like it makes them feel more at home", 107.52, 112.14], ["like they do not have to ask where things are and", 109.29, 116.49], ["it is like their own little kit", 112.14, 116.49], ["also another great tip is to add a little card with the Wi Fi passcode", 112.14, 120.899], ["or I am just putting a cute tag on the side of the basket with the Wi Fi passcode so that they do not have to ask and if they get logged out they can always log back in so you can go as crazy as you want with this or as minimal you can put water and a snack if I know someone is going to be staying for a while", 116.49, 139.65], ["I will do kind of a bigger basket", 133.53, 141.0], ["I do find that when people have been traveling for a long time for several hours they generally are tired they just want to take a shower and relax so I am putting a few clean towels on the bed", 135.0, 152.13000000000002], ["I have a hand towel and a few body towels as well I am going to just put that right next to the basket if they are staying more than a few days I like to add a hamper to the guest room so that they have somewhere to put their worn items and", 148.08, 170.91], ["I also like to leave out an extra phone charger for their iPhones or iPads", 167.34, 176.64], ["and I took my dollar store DIY tray added some flowers some lemon water and the remote controls on it", 170.91, 181.07999999999998], ["I wrote a little letter thanking the guests for coming and also wrote out instructions on how to work the remote controls you can do this in the living room as well or wherever you have a TV with remote controls that you think that they might not be able to use this is a great tip for babysitter is as well because most of the time when people come to stay at your house their house sitting there babysitting", 176.64, 198.93], ["or there is their guests", 195.75, 198.93], ["they do not know how to use the remote control so it is helpful to do this so a quick thank you note and instructions on how to use the remote controls and that pretty much finishes up the guest room like I said I do not always get a chance to do the basket sometimes I always pretty much leave out flowers and water and things like that", 195.75, 216.75], ["but you can go depending on how much time you have you can go as crazy as you want make your guests feel extra extra special", 212.7, 221.99], ["so now I am moving on to the guest bathroom even when we did live in apartments", 232.68, 240.57999999999998], ["and we did not have a guest bedroom I started putting a basket of toiletries out and", 237.01, 244.36], ["every time we would have someone stay with us they would always use up everything I put in the basket so it kind of became a habit of mine to refill it constantly", 240.58, 251.76999999999998], ["so that is why do keep a basket in the guest bathroom stocked at all times and even if it is just someone who is coming for a day or they are there for a few hours I find that people like to rummage through there and use some of the things if I know I am having someone for a longer period of time", 247.54, 266.47], ["I add a bunch more things", 261.91, 266.47], ["so I kind of rummage through the Travel section at Target or", 264.1, 270.97], ["you can go to the dollar store", 266.47, 273.669], ["but I put travel toothpaste travel toothbrushes hand cream shade cream razors shampoo and conditioner soap", 269.169, 282.03000000000003], ["face wipes", 277.72, 282.03000000000003], ["just whatever things that they will need for the bathroom and so that is why keep that in there pretty much at all times I try to keep it stocked also with like ear swabs and different things", 277.72, 292.93], ["so that is why always have that", 289.0, 292.93], ["and then I do put flowers and a candle in the bathroom", 290.83, 296.26], ["as well I pretty much have that no matter what if I mean not on every single day because sometimes my son is in there", 292.93, 301.21], ["and it is not", 298.15, 301.21], ["it is kind of a mess", 298.15, 302.71], ["but if I know someone is gonna be coming and staying with us", 299.62, 304.51], ["I do try to clean it up a little bit and tidy it", 301.21, 306.28], ["and then I do like to hang some robes so they have comfy robes and that is pretty much everything that I do in the bathroom now for the living room", 302.71, 314.979], ["you can add you know comfy throw blankets and that is always nice to have around most people love their morning cup of coffee", 310.479, 322.21], ["so a nice added touch is to create a little area on your kitchen counter or a side table for a coffee bar so you can stock up on coffee you can set out sugar and mugs and spoons and basically create a little self serve coffee bar so your guests can help themselves to anything they d like without having to wake you up in the morning or worry about rummaging around through the kitchen they can kind of help themselves to some hot cocoa or a late night tea or an early morning coffee", 318.52, 349.479], ["everything is right there for them", 345.34, 351.85], ["so that is why feel comfortable", 347.8, 351.85], ["and I definitely find you know we have had more and more people stay with us since we moved into this house", 349.479, 357.46000000000004], ["and I do find that this is something that they go over too", 353.41, 360.729], ["and they help themselves", 357.46, 360.729], ["so the point of all of this obviously is to make your guests feel appreciated", 357.46, 364.69], ["and you know you want to read your guests you might have someone who would think this is excessive", 362.8, 370.21], ["and it would make them feel uncomfortable so it is really kind of about knowing your audience and knowing who is coming and if they would appreciate these types of things and", 366.729, 379.56899999999996], ["it is also about adding your own personal touch of hospitality when your guests come so it does not seem unnatural or fake", 375.669, 385.44899999999996], ["so maybe if you implement one or two of these ideas and you kind of add your own personal touch your own unique ideas to make your guests feel extra special when they come to visit", 381.34, 394.81], ["and I do think the extra planning and attention to detail will stay with them for a long time and be appreciated so that is why hope you enjoyed

kind of get the hint it is also a great tip if you are having a last minute get together because you do not have to clean the entire house", 79.7, 89.42], ["my next tip is to prepare and when you prepare it is preparing for the worst thing that could happen when you have a bunch of guests over so that is why like to have stain removals on hand because people are hanging out maybe dropping drinks and you can make a homemade one with vinegar and about 20 drops of essential oils", 84.92, 107.78], ["a spot cleaner is definitely something you should have around your house in general",
